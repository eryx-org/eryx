/// Networking interfaces for the eryx sandbox.
///
/// Provides TCP and TLS networking for Python code running in the sandbox.
/// TCP enables plain connections (http://localhost), while TLS provides
/// secure encrypted connections.
///
/// ## Design Notes
///
/// This is a minimal, client-only networking interface using Component Model
/// native async (`async func`). It differs from wasi-sockets in several ways:
///
/// - Uses native async instead of start-*/finish-* polling pattern
/// - Includes TLS as a first-class interface (wasi-sockets doesn't have TLS)
/// - Client-only (no bind/listen/accept for servers)
/// - Host-controlled DNS resolution and network policy
/// - Simple u32 handles instead of resource types with streams
///
/// ## Future: wasi-sockets Migration
///
/// When WASI 0.3 adds native async support to wasi-sockets (expected ~2026),
/// we may migrate to it for better standards compliance and portability.
/// Key blockers for migration:
///
/// 1. wasi-sockets needs native async (not start-*/finish-*)
/// 2. A wasi-tls proposal needs to mature (or we keep our tls interface)
/// 3. We'd need to virtualize away server-side APIs we don't want to expose
///
/// See: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sockets
/// See: https://wasi.dev/roadmap
